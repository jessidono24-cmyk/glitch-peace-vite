# 🧘 Dream Yoga & Embodiment Integration

**Purpose**: Transform GLITCH·PEACE into an embodiment machine and dream yoga practice tool  
**Goal**: Facilitate lucid dreaming, body awareness, and consciousness continuity  
**Status**: Design phase - ready for implementation

---

## 🎯 Vision Statement

GLITCH·PEACE serves as a bridge between waking consciousness and dream states, cultivating embodied awareness that persists across both realms. Through gameplay mechanics that mirror dream yoga practices, players develop:

1. **Reality testing habits** that transfer to dreams
2. **Body awareness** that grounds consciousness
3. **Pattern recognition** for dream signs
4. **Lucidity skills** for conscious dreaming
5. **Embodiment** for physical-digital integration

## 🌙 Dream Yoga Principles

### What is Dream Yoga?
Dream yoga is a Tibetan Buddhist practice of maintaining consciousness during sleep states. It involves:
- **Lucid dreaming** - Becoming aware you're dreaming while in the dream
- **Dream signs** - Recurring symbols that indicate dream state
- **Reality testing** - Habitual checks to determine if awake or dreaming
- **Sleep awareness** - Maintaining consciousness through sleep transitions
- **Dream control** - Directing dream content with awareness

### Game Integration
The game teaches dream yoga through:
1. **Frequent reality checks** during gameplay
2. **Pattern recognition** that trains dream sign awareness
3. **Symbolic mechanics** that mirror dream logic
4. **Consciousness continuity** across game sessions
5. **Intention setting** before and after play

---

## 🏋️ Embodiment Principles

### What is Embodiment?
Embodiment is the practice of conscious awareness of the physical body and its sensations. It includes:
- **Somatic awareness** - Feeling body sensations
- **Proprioception** - Knowing body position in space
- **Energy body** - Awareness of subtle energy (chi/prana)
- **Breath consciousness** - Awareness of breathing patterns
- **Grounding** - Connection to physical presence

### Game Integration
The game cultivates embodiment through:
1. **Body scan tiles** that prompt sensation awareness
2. **Breath sync mechanics** that link gameplay to breathing
3. **Energy flow** visualization through chakra system
4. **Somatic feedback** for in-game actions
5. **Grounding anchors** during intense gameplay
