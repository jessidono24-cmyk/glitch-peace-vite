## ✅ Verification After Push

After you push, verify by:

1. **Visit**: https://github.com/jessidono24-cmyk/glitch-peace-vite
2. **Check**: README should show v2.0 comprehensive description
3. **See**: All documentation files visible
4. **Test**: Clone and run the game

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jessidono24-cmyk/glitch-peace-vite.git
cd glitch-peace-vite
npm install
npm run dev
```

Both modes should work perfectly!

## 🔧 Alternative: Push with Force (If Needed)

If normal push fails due to conflicts:

```bash
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

This safely pushes your merged version.

⚠️ **Note**: Only use if normal push fails!
