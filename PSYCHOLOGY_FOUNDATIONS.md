# PSYCHOLOGY & NEUROSCIENCE FOUNDATIONS

## Overview

This document synthesizes the psychological, neuroscientific, and sociological research foundations underlying GLITCH·PEACE's design. All game systems are grounded in peer-reviewed science and established theory.

## Psychological Foundations

### Learning Psychology

#### Implicit Learning Theory (Arthur Reber)
**Core Idea**: Complex knowledge can be acquired without conscious awareness of what's being learned.

**Key Findings:**
- Implicit learning is fast, automatic, and efficient
- More robust than explicit learning
- Resistant to disorders that affect explicit memory
- Doesn't require working memory resources
- Transfers across contexts

**Application in GLITCH·PEACE:**
- Grammar patterns learned through exposure
- Game mechanics become intuitive
- Strategy develops unconsciously
- Patterns extracted automatically

#### Skill Acquisition Theory (Fitts & Posner)
**Core Idea**: Skills develop through three stages: cognitive, associative, autonomous.

**Stages:**
1. **Cognitive**: Conscious, slow, error-prone
2. **Associative**: Faster, patterns emerge, fewer errors
3. **Autonomous**: Automatic, fast, effortless

**Application:**
- Tutorial = cognitive stage
- Mid-game = associative stage
- Mastery = autonomous stage
- Each stage designed appropriately

#### Flow Theory (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)
**Core Idea**: Optimal experience occurs when challenge matches skill.

**Flow Conditions:**
1. Clear goals
2. Immediate feedback
3. Balance of challenge and skill
4. Merging of action and awareness
5. Loss of self-consciousness
6. Sense of control
7. Time distortion
8. Autotelic experience

**Application:**
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Clear objectives always
- Instant feedback systems
- Calibrated challenges
- Immersive gameplay

#### Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan)
**Core Idea**: Intrinsic motivation requires autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

**Three Needs:**
1. **Autonomy**: Sense of volition and choice
2. **Competence**: Feel effective and masterful
3. **Relatedness**: Connection to others

**Application:**
- Player choices matter (autonomy)
- Visible skill progression (competence)
- Community features planned (relatedness)
- Intrinsic rewards emphasized

### Cognitive Psychology

#### Working Memory Model (Baddeley & Hitch)
**Core Idea**: Working memory has distinct components with limited capacity.

**Components:**
1. **Central Executive**: Control and coordination
2. **Phonological Loop**: Verbal information
3. **Visuospatial Sketchpad**: Visual/spatial information
4. **Episodic Buffer**: Integrates information

**Application:**
- UI designed to minimize working memory load
- Visual and spatial information primary
- Verbal information minimal
- Chunking reduces cognitive load

#### Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)
**Core Idea**: Learning is optimized when cognitive load is managed.

**Three Types of Load:**

2. **Extraneous**: Unnecessary difficulty
3. **Germane**: Productive learning effort

**Application:**
- Eliminate extraneous load (clean UI)
- Calibrate intrinsic load (difficulty scaling)
- Maximize germane load (skill development)

#### Dual Coding Theory (Paivio)

- Build lasting personal resources
- Undo negative emotions
- Facilitate resilience

**Application:**
