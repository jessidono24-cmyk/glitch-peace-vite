## 🔒 What About Branch Protection Rules?

### What They Are:
Branch protection rules are **optional** security features that:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass
- Prevent force pushes
- Prevent accidental deletion

### Do You Need Them?
**Not for changing the default branch!**

### When They're Useful:
- 👥 Team projects with multiple contributors
- 🔐 Production branches needing extra safety
- 🌍 Open source projects with community contributions
- ✅ When you want required code reviews

### Your Situation:
Since it's your personal project:
- ✅ You have full control as the owner
- ✅ Can change default branch without any rules
- ✅ Protection rules are completely optional
- ✅ Can add them later if needed
