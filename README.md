# GLITCH·PEACE

**A consciousness-awakening game disguised as a puzzle-action experience.**

Begin in stillness. Emerge through pattern recognition.

> v2.0-alpha | February 2026 | JavaScript + Vite

## What This Is

GLITCH·PEACE is a multi-modal browser game built around four interlocking
purposes:

1. **Consciousness emergence** — meta-awareness through interactive play
2. **Addiction cessation support** — gentle stress inoculation, no shame spirals
3. **Learning acceleration** — embodied language and pattern recognition
4. **Intelligence enhancement** — IQ and EQ development through gameplay

It is not a simple game. It is a consciousness engine that looks like a game.

## In Progress 🔧

- 🔧 RPGMode full wiring (generateGrid export)
- 🔧 Research integration (psychology/neuroscience applied to systems)
- 🔧 Leaderboard (Supabase — needs credentials)
- 🔧 AI procedural content (needs server + API keys)

---

## Planned 📋

- 📋 Ornithology game mode (independent, non-grid)
- 📋 Mycology game mode (independent, non-grid)
- 📋 Narrative/RPG standalone mode
- 📋 First-person shooter mode
- 📋 Godot rebuild for 3D graphics fidelity
- 📋 Online co-op
- 📋 Steam integration

## Design Laws (CANON)

1. No shame spirals — relapse ≠ failure
2. Sterilized wisdom — no dogma, simulation framing only
3. Player identity is stable — cyan/white never changes
4. Accessibility first — reduced motion, high contrast always available
5. Hearth is always reachable — pause anytime, no data loss
6. Embodiment maximized — learning through body, action, experience
7. Effortless by design — align with natural cognition
8. Sovereign codex compliance — individual sovereignty always respected

See `CANON.md`, `SOVEREIGN_CODEX.md`, `EMBODIMENT.md` in docs/ for full principles.
