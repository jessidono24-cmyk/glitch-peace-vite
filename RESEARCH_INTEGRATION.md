### Integration Process

When new research files are added:

1. **Review**: Read and understand the research
2. **Extract**: Identify key principles and findings
3. **Document**: Add insights to appropriate docs
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link to relevant systems
5. **Update**: Modify design documents as needed
6. **Implement**: Apply learnings to game systems

### File Organization

Research files should be organized as:

```
docs/
├── research/                    # New subdirectory for research
│   ├── psychology/             # Psychology papers and notes
│   ├── neuroscience/           # Neuroscience research
│   ├── sociology/              # Sociological research
│   ├── cognitive-architecture/ # Personal cognitive notes
│   └── synthesis/              # Integration notes
```

## Research Priorities

### High Priority (Core to Mission)

1. **Embodiment & Learning**: How physical action enhances cognition
2. **Implicit Learning**: Unconscious skill acquisition
3. **Flow States**: Optimal experience and performance
4. **Addiction Neuroscience**: Brain changes in addiction/recovery
5. **Consciousness Research**: Emergence and awakening

### Medium Priority (Enhancement)

1. **Memory Consolidation**: Sleep and offline learning
2. **Emotional Intelligence**: EQ development research
3. **Social Learning**: Community and peer effects
4. **Transfer of Learning**: Skill generalization
5. **Individual Differences**: Personalization research

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Advanced Neuroscience**: Detailed mechanisms
2. **Cultural Psychology**: Cross-cultural considerations
3. **Developmental Psychology**: Age-specific designs
4. **Personality Psychology**: Individual traits
5. **Positive Psychology**: Wellbeing optimization
