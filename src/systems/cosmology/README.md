# Cosmology Systems

This directory contains systems for integrating diverse wisdom traditions into gameplay.

## Purpose

GLITCH·PEACE presents multiple wisdom traditions as exploration tools, without claiming metaphysical reality. Players can engage with spiritual concepts in a simulation framework.

## Core Systems (To Be Implemented)

### chakra-system.js
Hindu chakra energy system:
- 7 chakras as power-up system
- Energy flow mechanics
- Blockage = game challenges
- Balanced chakras = optimal play
- **Framing**: "In this simulation, chakras work like this..."

### tarot-archetypes.js
Tarot major arcana as game archetypes:
- 22 major arcana as character aspects
- Archetypal powers and lessons
- Journey through the cards
- **Framing**: "Let's explore what these symbols mean..."

### i-ching-hexagrams.js
I Ching hexagrams for guidance:
- 64 hexagrams as situation patterns
- Changing lines as game state
- Wisdom without fortune-telling
- **Framing**: "This pattern suggests..."

### tree-of-life.js
Kabbalistic Tree of Life:
- 10 sephirot as progression stages
- Paths between states
- Different qualities of consciousness
- **Framing**: "This map shows relationships..."

### medicine-wheel.js
Indigenous wisdom traditions:
- Directions and their meanings
- Elemental balance
- Cyclical understanding
- **Framing**: "This tradition teaches..."

## Design Principles (Critical)

1. **Sterilized Wisdom** - NEVER claim metaphysical truth
2. **Simulation Framing** - "In this game/simulation/model..."
3. **Educational Approach** - "This tradition believes..."
4. **Respectful Representation** - Honor source traditions
5. **No Dogma** - Present as tools, not truth
6. **Player Interpretation** - Meaning is personal
7. **Multiple Traditions** - Show diversity, no hierarchy

## Language Patterns (Mandatory)

### ✅ Good Framing
- "In this simulation, chakras represent..."
- "This tradition maps consciousness as..."
- "Let's explore what this symbol means..."
- "According to this model..."
- "This pattern can be interpreted as..."

### ❌ Bad Framing (Never Use)
- "Chakras are real energy centers"
- "The universe works this way"
- "This is the truth about..."
- "You must believe..."
- "This is how it actually is"

## Multi-Tradition Synthesis

Show how different traditions map similar territory:
- Chakras ≈ Tree of Life ≈ Internal energy
- Tarot ≈ Archetypes ≈ Psychological patterns
- I Ching ≈ Change patterns ≈ Life situations
- All are maps, not the territory

## Accessibility

Players can:
- Enable/disable any tradition
- Mix and match systems
- Ignore entirely if desired
- Deep dive if interested

## Educational Value

Each system teaches:
- Cultural wisdom traditions
- Symbolic thinking
- Pattern recognition
- Holistic perspectives
- Comparative philosophy

## Implementation Cautions

1. **Avoid Cultural Appropriation** - Respectful representation
2. **No Syncretism Claims** - Don't say traditions are "the same"
3. **Acknowledge Complexity** - Simplified for gameplay
4. **Link to Resources** - Point to authentic sources
5. **Consult Experts** - Get cultural consultation
6. **Player Agency** - Optional, not required

## Future Expansion

- Buddhist concepts (mindfulness, emptiness)
- Hermetic principles
- Alchemy
- Mythology (Greek, Norse, etc.)
- Shamanic traditions
- Modern psychology
- Scientific models

## Implementation Status

🔲 Not yet implemented - Awaiting Phase 10 development

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed implementation plans.

**Critical Note**: This system must be handled with extreme care. The goal is education and exploration, never indoctrination or appropriation. When in doubt, be more explicit about simulation framing.
