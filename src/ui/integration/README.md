# Integration Systems

This directory contains systems that synthesize and connect all other systems.

## Purpose

The integration layer provides unified tracking, visualization, and synthesis of progress across all game systems. It helps players see the big picture and understand how different aspects connect.

## Core Systems (To Be Implemented)

### progress-dashboard.js
Unified progress tracking:
- All systems in one view
- Visual progress indicators
- Trend analysis
- Milestone celebrations
- Holistic growth metrics

### insights-journal.js
Personal discovery recording:
- Capture realizations
- Tag by system/domain
- Search and review
- Pattern identification in insights
- Export/share functionality

### wisdom-synthesis.js
Connect learnings across domains:
- Show relationships between systems
- Cross-pollination of insights
- Meta-learning tracking
- Wisdom emergence indicators
- Integration suggestions

### transformation-map.js
Visualize growth journey:
- Multi-dimensional growth visualization
- Timeline view
- Pattern view
- Network view (connections)
- Before/after comparisons

## Design Principles

1. **Holistic View** - See whole picture, not just parts
2. **Connection Focus** - Highlight relationships
3. **Meaning Making** - Help player understand their journey
4. **Non-Prescriptive** - Player interprets their data
5. **Privacy First** - Data stays with player
6. **Aesthetic Beauty** - Visualization is art
