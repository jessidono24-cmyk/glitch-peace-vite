# Intelligence Systems

This directory contains systems for enhancing cognitive (IQ) and emotional (EQ) intelligence.

## Purpose

GLITCH·PEACE strengthens both analytical and emotional intelligence through graduated challenges, pattern recognition, and social-emotional scenarios.

## Subdirectories

### cognitive/ (IQ Development)
Systems for analytical intelligence:
- **logic-puzzles.js** - Embedded logical challenges
- **strategic-thinking.js** - Planning and strategy mechanics
- **creative-problem-solving.js** - Novel solution finding

### emotional/ (EQ Development)
Systems for emotional intelligence:
- **empathy-training.js** - Perspective-taking mechanics
- **emotion-recognition.js** - Identify and label emotions
- **social-intelligence.js** - Understand social dynamics

## Design Principles

1. **Progressive Difficulty** - Start easy, gradually increase
2. **Multiple Approaches** - Various valid solutions
3. **Immediate Feedback** - Clear results
4. **Transfer Learning** - Skills apply broadly
5. **Intrinsic Motivation** - Challenges are engaging
6. **Growth Mindset** - Failure is learning

## Cognitive Intelligence (IQ)

### Pattern Recognition
- Grid patterns
- Enemy behavior patterns
- Fibonacci sequences
- Dreamscape progression patterns
- Tile interaction patterns

### Logical Reasoning
- If-then relationships
- Cause and effect
- Deductive reasoning
- Inductive reasoning

## Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

### Self-Awareness
- Recognize own emotions (via emotional engine)
- Understand emotional triggers
- Monitor emotional states
- Track emotional patterns

### Self-Regulation
- Manage emotional responses
- Impulse control (impulse buffer!)
- Stress management
- Adaptive coping

### Empathy

- Growth mindset

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Emotional Engine → EQ Training
- Real-time emotion tracking
- Emotional pattern awareness
- Regulation mechanics
- Meta-emotional awareness

### Pattern Recognition → IQ Training
- Impulse buffer = strategic thinking
- Consequence preview = planning
- Enemy AI = pattern recognition
- Grid generation = spatial reasoning

### Temporal System → Both
- Time awareness
- Cyclical thinking
- Patience development
- Long-term planning

## Graduated Challenges

### Level 1-3: Foundation
