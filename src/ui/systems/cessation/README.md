## Design Principles (from CANON.md)

1. **No Shame Spirals** - Relapse ≠ failure, it's data
2. **Compassionate Messaging** - Gentle, supportive language

4. **Non-Judgmental** - Observe patterns without criticism
5. **Empowering** - Player always in control
6. **Gradual Progress** - Small wins celebrated
7. **Hearth Always Available** - Safe space to return to

## Integration Points

- **Temporal System** - Time-based interventions
- **Emotional Engine** - Emotional awareness = cessation tool
- **Pause Menu** - Access cessation tools anytime
- **Dreamscapes** - Themed around recovery stages
- **Archetypes** - Recovery-focused powers
- **HUD** - Display wellness metrics

## Cessation Stages Alignment

Game progression can mirror recovery stages:
1. **Void State** - Recognition/awareness
2. **Dragon Realm** - Confronting the beast
3. **Courtyard** - Finding stillness
4. **Leaping Field** - Taking action
5. **Summit** - Achievement/clarity
6. **Childhood** - Healing origins
7. **Bedroom Gunfight** - Facing fears
8. **Aztec Chase** - Running from/to self
9. **Orb Escape** - Liberation
10. **Integration** - Wholeness

## Gentle Stress Inoculation

The game builds resilience through:
- Graduated challenges (not overwhelming)
- Safe failure states (learn from mistakes)
- Recovery mechanics (always bounce back)
- Pause accessibility (never trapped)
- Progress persistence (never lose everything)

## Metrics (Non-Judgmental)

Track indicators without judgment:
- Session patterns (frequency, duration)
- Emotional states (via emotional engine)
- Urge intensity (when they arise)
- Coping strategy effectiveness
- Overall wellness trends

## Future Expansion

- Multiple addiction types (substance, behavioral)
- Customizable intervention timing
- Integration with external trackers
- Support group features
- Professional therapy integration
- Research partnership opportunities
