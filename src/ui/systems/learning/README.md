# Learning Systems

This directory contains all systems related to accelerating learning through gameplay.

## Purpose

GLITCH·PEACE is designed to boost language acquisition and mathematical understanding through immersive, context-based learning. Learning happens naturally as players engage with the game mechanics.

## Subdirectories

### language/
Systems for language learning and acquisition:
- **vocabulary-engine.js** - Contextual word learning through tile interactions
- **grammar-patterns.js** - Sentence structure learning through game messages
- **pronunciation-practice.js** - Audio-based language practice
- **immersion-context.js** - Situational language use

### mathematics/
Systems for mathematical thinking and pattern recognition:
- **pattern-recognition.js** - Identify patterns in grid, enemies, progression
- **fibonacci-teaching.js** - Explicit teaching of Fibonacci sequences
- **spatial-reasoning.js** - Grid-based spatial thinking
- **problem-solving.js** - Mathematical puzzle integration

### meta-learning/
Systems for learning how to learn:
- **attention-training.js** - Focus and concentration mechanics
- **memory-techniques.js** - Encoding and recall strategies
- **transfer-learning.js** - Apply learnings across contexts

## Design Principles

1. **Implicit Learning** - Learning happens naturally through play
2. **Context Matters** - All learning tied to meaningful situations
3. **Progressive Difficulty** - Gradual increase in complexity
4. **Multiple Modalities** - Visual, auditory, kinesthetic learning
5. **Immediate Feedback** - Clear indicators of understanding
6. **Spaced Repetition** - Review concepts over time
7. **Joyful Discovery** - Learning feels rewarding, not forced

## Integration Points

- **Tile System** - Different tiles can teach different concepts
- **Enemy AI** - Enemy patterns can teach mathematical concepts
- **Dreamscapes** - Each dreamscape can have a learning theme
- **Messages** - In-game text teaches language naturally
- **Archetypes** - Powers can be learning-related
- **HUD** - Display learning metrics and progress

## Future Expansion

- Support for multiple languages (initially English)
- Advanced mathematics (algebra, calculus)
- Scientific concepts (physics, chemistry)
- Historical contexts
- Cultural learning
- Music theory
- Art concepts

## Implementation Status

🔲 Not yet implemented - Awaiting Phase 6 development

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed implementation plans.
